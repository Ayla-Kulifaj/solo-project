# STONKS 

Welcome! This is my first solo project; WOW, do I have a newfound respect for the arts of creation and coding. The inspiration for me to tackle a Stock Visualization app comes from a friend who specializes in Machine Learning. He will connect a server to monitor the outcomes of his algorithm. As much as I would love to dive into the details of his work, I have not yet obtained the data to do so! Anyhow, let me introduce you to the initial stages of my project. Thank you for joining me on this journey and allowing me the opportunity to share my creation. Welcome to the bare bones of what I hope will evolve into a robust tool for stock analysis!
